- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

Next.js: Next.js is a React web development framework that enables the creation of web applications with server-side rendering and simple routing. It offers several powerful features such as static and dynamic page generation, pre-rendering, image optimization, and much more.

Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS design framework that simplifies the creation of custom and responsive user interfaces. Instead of writing traditional CSS styles, Tailwind allows for building interfaces using pre-defined classes representing specific styles like colors, spacing, typography, and hover effects.

Fontsource: Fontsource is a library that facilitates the embedding of open-source fonts in web projects. In this project, we utilized the Figtree font provided by Fontsource to style text and provide a unique and appealing aesthetic for the user interface.

In addition to these core technologies, we also leveraged other resources, such as:

Next/Image: The Next.js Image component was used to optimize and render images efficiently, ensuring fast loading times and a visually pleasing experience for the user.
